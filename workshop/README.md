## Get the Cert: Learn how to build your next app with Kubernetes, Istio and advanced services like Watson
Do you need to select the right technologies to build your next application? Get your hands dirty with those technologies before you start your build. 

Learn how Kubernetes and Istio give you full control over your microservices. Kubernetes minimizes outages and disruptions through self-healing, intelligent scheduling, horizontal scaling, and load balancing. Istio gives you security, advanced routing, policy and insights into your application. Our developers will walk you through the step-by-step in this Hands-on-Lab, and you'll walk away with a certification badge.
